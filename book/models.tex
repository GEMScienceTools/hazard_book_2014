This chapter describes the seismic source typologies supported by the OQ-engine: \textit{Point} and
\textit{Area} sources for modeling distributed seismicity, \textit{Simple Fault}, \textit{Complex Fault}, and
\textit{Characteristic Fault} for modeling fault-based seismcity.

\section{Basic concepts}
The OQ-engine provides several seismic source typologies to accomodate different modeling approaches. For modeling distributed seismicity, that is seismic activity occurring over a geographilcal region and not tight to
specific well characterized fault structures, the OQ-engine provides the \textit{Point} and \textit{Area} sources.
The former defines seismic activity nucleating in a single geographical location, while the second seismicity occurring uniformly over a geographical region. A collection of Point sources can be used to model seismicity with spatially variable parameters (as obtained from a smoothed seismicity approach for instance), while Area
sources can be used to model seismicity in geographic zones usually defined by expert judgments
taking into account seismological, geological and geodetic information.\\
For modeling fault-based seismicity, that is seismic activity occurring on a well identified and characterized
fault zone, the OQ-engine provides two main options, the \textit{Simple Fault} and \textit{Complex Fault}
sources. Both source typologies allows modeling earthquakes on faults as \textit{floating ruptures}, that is as
portions of the fault surface which are moved (that is 'floated') over the entire fault surface to simulate all possible rupture locations. The two source typologies differs instead in terms of the geometrical complexity
they can accomodate when modeling a fault surface. In particular, a Simple Fault source can model a fault
surface as a plain rectangle in the simplest case, or a set of connected parallelograms in the most complex
case. A Complex Fault source can instead model an arbitrarily complex quadrilateral surface, which can
therefore accomodate changes in dip angle along depth or along strike or changes in fault width. The
Complex Fault source is therefore particularly suitable for modeling large subdution interface surfaces, while
Simple Fault sources can be used for modeling crustal faults. The \textit{Characteristic Fault} source can model both simple and complex geometries, but instead of simulating floating ruptures, each earthquake
rupture the entire fault surface indipendently of the associated magnitude. The Characteristic Source typology
can be used to model individual faults or fault segments that tend to produce essentialy same size
earthquakes (CITE SCHWARTZ COPPERSMITH 1984).\\
\section{The Point and Area sources}
The parameters required for the definition of Point and Area sources, and their associated function, are listed in Table \ref{table:point_area_tab}.

Sources are parameterized so that earthquake ruptures are modeled as planar rectangles in a 3D space. In a point-source representation (Figure 1) ruptures are generated underneath a single geographical location, and can be potentially distributed over multiple orientations, faulting styles, and depth levels.

\caption{Graphical representation of the earthquake ruptures as generated by a Point Source. a) Given a geographical location on the earth surface, ruptures are generated underneath according to a scaling relationship and aspect ratio value and forced to not exceed the upper and lower seismogenic depths. Ruptures can be distributed over multiple dips b), strikes c) and hypocentral depths d).}
\label{fig:PointSource}
\end{figure}
Rupture centroids are co-located with the point-source location and are positioned at depths specified by the hypocentral depth distribution. Rupture shapes follow the given aspect ratio. However, if for a given aspect ratio and hypocentral depth the rupture plane crosses either boundary (upper or lower) of the seismogenic layer, the plane is shifted along the dip direction so as to fit within the upper and lower seismogenic depths. As a consequence, the hypocentral location no longer corresponds with the plane centroid. If this adjustment is insufficient to avoid crossing either boundary of the seismogenic layer, the plane is reshaped; the width becomes the maximum allowed by the seismogenic layer thickness, and the length is increased so as to conserve rupture area (at the expense of the aspect ratio).\\
In an area source (Figure 2), earthquake ruptures are distributed over a regular grid (equally-spaced in distance) covering a geographical region as defined by a seismic zone. Generation of ruptures follows the same algorithm as for point sources. For both sources, the rate associated to each rupture plane is the original rate associated to the corresponding magnitude bin, scaled by the location weight (1 for a point source and 1 / N for an area source, where N is the total number of grid points in the area), the nodal plane (that is orientation and faulting style) weight, and the hypocentral depth weight.\\
For an area source, the boundary is assumed ‘leaky’, that is earthquake ruptures can extend out of it. Because of rupture area conservation, earthquake surfaces associated to large magnitudes can extend well beyond the source boundaries. If the rupture orientation is considered random then this behavior can potentially lead to unrealistic scenarios, that is earthquake ruptures that are not consistent with the area geometry and the tectonic feature it is meant to represent. The design of an area source requires therefore a careful estimation not only of the associated activity rates but also of the predominant faulting orientations.\\
